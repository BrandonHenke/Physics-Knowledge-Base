# An Approach to Electromagnetism With Geometric Algebra

The spacetime algebra is generated by the vector space $\text{span}\{\gamma_0,\gamma_1,\gamma_2,\gamma_3\}$, where $\gamma_0^2 = -1$ and $\gamma_i^2=1$.
Additionally, one can define the even blade subalgebra elements $\sigma_i = \gamma_i\gamma_0$.

## Phase Space

In Hamiltonian mechanics, one is introduced to the idea of a phase space, where the state of the system is described by generallized coordinates $q = q^k v_k$ and generallized momenta $p = p^k u_k$.
Then a "phase space vector" of the system is given by $r = q + p$.
The derivative of this is given by:
$$
\begin{align}
	\dot{r} &= \dot{q} + \dot{p},\\
	&= \dot{q}^k v_k + \dot{p}^k u_k,\\
	&= \frac{\partial H}{\partial p^k}v_k-\frac{\partial H}{\partial q^k} u_k,\\
	&= \sum_k \left( \frac{\partial H}{\partial q^k}v_k+\frac{\partial H}{\partial p^k} u_k \right)\cdot \left( u_k \wedge v_k\right),\\
	&= \nabla H \cdot J,
\end{align}
$$
where
$$
\begin{equation}
	J = \sum_k (u_k \wedge v_k)
\end{equation}
$$
is the doubling bivector.
This doubling bivector creates a natural complex structure, and can be used to write the phase space vector as
$$
	r = q + J \cdot p,
$$
where $q,p \in \text{span}\{v_1, \dots, v_n\}$.

## Electromagnetic Field

Consider an abstract phase space vector, $v = e + J \cdot b$,
where $e,b \in \text{span}\{\sigma_1,\sigma_2,\sigma_3\}$.

The Hamiltonian is
$$
	H = \frac{1}{2m} \left(p+\frac{q_e}{c}a\right)^2 + \phi(q),
$$
and
$$
\dot{v} = \nabla H \cdot J.
$$
