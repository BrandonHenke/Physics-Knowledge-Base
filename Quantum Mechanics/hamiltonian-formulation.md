# Hamiltonian Formulation
###### see [Quantum Mechanics](QM-overview.md)

The Hamiltonian formulation of Quantum Mechanics shares many commonalities with [Hamiltonian Mechanics](../Classical%20Mechanics/hamiltonian-mechanics.md).

Where Hamiltonian Mechanics has random variables, Quantum Mechanics has [[quantum-operators]]ators](operators.md).

Where Hamiltonian Mechanics has probability distributions, Quantum Mechanics has [quantum states](quantum-states.md).
