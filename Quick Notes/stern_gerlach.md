# Stern-Gerlach Experiment

* Magnetic moment through a diverging magnetic field produces a force proportional to the inner product between the moment and the field.
* Expectation: A beam of unknown magnetic moments going through a diverging magnetic field will have different amounts of deflection, effectively spreading the beam parallel to the field.
* Reality: A beam of unknown magnetic moments going through a diverging magnetic field is *split* into multiple beams.
* The splitting indicates that only select values of the magnetic moment are allowed.
