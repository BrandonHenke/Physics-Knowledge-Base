# Lagrangian Mechanics
###### see [Classical Mechanics](CM_overview.md)

Lagrangian Mechanics is a very powerful formulation of classical mechanics, which makes use of a function called the Lagrangian, $L(x,t)$, along with the [Principle of Stationary Action](action.md#principle-of-stationary-action), which gives rise to the Euler-Lagrange equations.

The idea behind this approach to classical physics is that the state of the system is completely characterized by $n$ generalized co-ordinates, $x$.
