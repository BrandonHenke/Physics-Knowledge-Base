# Hamiltonian Formulation
###### see [Quantum Mechanics](QM_overview.md)

The Hamiltonian formulation of Quantum Mechanics shares many commonalities with [Hamiltonian Mechanics](../Classical%20Mechanics/hamiltonian_mechanics.md).

Where Hamiltonian Mechanics has random variables, Quantum Mechanics has [Quantum Operators](quantum_operators.md).

Where Hamiltonian Mechanics has probability distributions, Quantum Mechanics has [quantum states](quantum_states.md).
