## Hamiltonian Formulation
<div style="display:none">$\nextSection$</div>

The Hamiltonian formulation of Quantum Mechanics shares many commonalities with [Hamiltonian mechanics](../Classical_Mechanics/hamiltonian_mechanics.html).[](../Classical_Mechanics/hamiltonian_mechanics.md)

Where Hamiltonian Mechanics has random variables, Quantum Mechanics has [quantum operators](quantum_operators.html).[](quantum_operators.md)

Where Hamiltonian Mechanics has probability distributions, Quantum Mechanics has [quantum states](quantum_states.html).[](quantum_states.md)
